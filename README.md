TextTheSpire

Author: Wensber - textthespire@gmail.com

Description:

This is a mod for the game Slay the Spire and provides screen reader accessibility.
It does so by providing lots of windows displaying the game information and a prompt window for inputting commands.
Descriptions of the windows and commands are provided with the help command.

Status of Completion:

TextTheSpire works but can be improved.
There are currently no known bugs but there are some quality of life changes and features like daily run that can be added.
If you decide to use this mod and run into issues, let me know at textthespire@gmail.com.

Limitations:

TextTheSpire is currently not capable of accessing menus or screens not reached automatically by playing the game.
This includes save slots, statistics, achievements, compendium, run history, settings, patch notes, custom game, daily climb, etc.

Installation:

Step 1:

If you have not yet, install Steam, create an account, and install Java.

Step 2:

Download Slay the Spire from the Steam webpage. You do not need to do so through the Steam client which is harder for screen readers.
Subscribe to both BaseMod and ModTheSpire.

Step 3:

Find the Slay the Spire directory. In Windows the directory path should be similar to C/Program Files x 86/Steam/steamapps/common/SlayTheSpire.

Step 4:

Create a mods folder in the main directory. M o d s all lowercase. Create a shortcut of this folder on your desktop for easy access if you wish.

Step 5:

Create a shortcut of the file mts-launder.jar on your desktop. This is how you will start the game.

Step 6:

Download both CommunicationMod and TextTheSpire and put both in the mods folder.

Step 7:

Double click mts-launder to launch the mod. The first time you will need to select the mods.
There is a select all option on the Mod the Spire window that will show up.
Afterwards they will be auto selected. Hit enter to start the game. One more step.

Step 8:

You will need to set a save file name if you don't have a save file yet. Output should mention this as well.
Go to the main Slay the Spire window, type your name, and hit enter.
You are now free to play the game. Type help in the prompt to read about controls.
