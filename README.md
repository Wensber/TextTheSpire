TextTheSpire

Author: Wensber - textthespire@gmail.com

Description:

This is a mod for the game Slay the Spire and provides screen reader accessibility.
It does so by providing lots of windows displaying the game information and a prompt window for inputting commands.
Descriptions of the windows and commands are provided in the sections Display and Controls.

Status of Completion:

TextTheSpire is almost done. I hesitate to call it done for the following reason.
There are still potentially unknown bugs that need to be fixed.
For example, I previously discovered that TextTheSpire did not behave correctly with the relic Runic Dome.
You are not supposed to be able to see enemy intents while owning Runic Dome but TextTheSpire displayed the intents anyway.
I have not been able to check every single relic, card, and potential interactions between them that could cause bugs that are game breaking or simply messes up the display.
If you decide to use this mod and run into issues, let me know at textthespire@gmail.com.

Limitations:

TextTheSpire is currently not capable of accessing menus or screens not reached automatically by playing the game.
This includes save slots, statistics, achievements, compendium, run history, settings, patch notes, custom game, daily climb, etc.

Installation:

Step 1:

Step 2:

Download Slay the Spire from the Steam webpage. You do not need to do so through the Steam client which is harder for screen readers.
Subscribe to both BaseMod and ModTheSpire.

Step 3:

Find the Slay the Spire directory. In Windows the directory path should be similar to C/Program Files x 86/Steam/steamapps/common/SlayTheSpire.

Step 4:

Create a mods folder in the main directory. M o d s all lowercase. Create a shortcut of this folder on your desktop for easy access if you wish.

Step 5:

Create a shortcut of the file mts-launder.jar on your desktop. This is how you will start the game.

Step 6:

Download both CommunicationMod and TextTheSpire and put both in the mods folder.

Step 7:

Double click mts-launder to launch the mod. The first time you will need to select the mods.
There is a select all option on the Mod the Spire window that will show up.
Afterwards they will be auto selected. Hit enter to start the game.
