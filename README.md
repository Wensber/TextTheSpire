Description:

This is a mod for the game Slay the Spire and provides screen reader accessibility.
It does so by providing lots of windows displaying the game information and a prompt window for inputting commands.
Descriptions of the windows and commands are provided with the help command.

This mod supports Windows 64 bit. Other versions of the mod are experimental and can be found:

Read the Spire, mod that can auto read changes in windows: https://github.com/pitermach/ReadTheSpire

This one is almost a requirement as one of the characters Watcher does not seem to unlock without this.

Known Issues:

If a old run that you finished or overwrote appears again you can delete the run in the saves folder in the main Slay the Spire directory.
This folder is just the run saves and won't delete anything else.
This issue should be fixed now that restart has been replaced with abandon but might still appear for a bit if you've used the restart command recently.

Donations:

As of right now, I am not accepting donations and recommend you support NVDA instead. https://www.nvaccess.org/support-us/

Installation:

Note: If you use gog go here https://forum.audiogames.net/topic/35130/slay-the-spire-now-accessible/

Step 1:

If you have not yet, install Steam, create an account, and install Java.

Step 2:

Download Slay the Spire from the Steam webpage. You do not need to do so through the Steam client which is harder for screen readers.
Subscribe to both BaseMod and ModTheSpire.

Step 3:

Find the Slay the Spire directory. In Windows the directory path should be similar to C/Program Files x 86/Steam/steamapps/common/SlayTheSpire.

Step 4:

Create a shortcut of the file mts-launder.jar on your desktop. This is how you will start the game.

Step 5:

Double click mts-launder to launch the mod. The first time you will need to select the mods.
There is a select all option on the Mod the Spire window that will show up.
Afterwards they will be auto selected. Hit enter to start the game. One more step.

Step 6:

You will need to set a save file name if you don't have a save file yet. The Choices window should tell you how.
